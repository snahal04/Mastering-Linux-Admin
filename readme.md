# Skills required to become a system reliability engineer
1. **System Administration**: Knowledge of operating systems (such as Linux), `system configuration`, `package management`, `file systems`, and `monitoring tools`.

2. **Programming and Scripting**: Proficient in at least one programming language (such as `Python`, `Go`, or `Java`) and have experience with scripting languages like `Bash` or `PowerShell`.

3. **Cloud Computing**: Familiarity with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP is important. Understanding services like `virtual machines`, `containers`, and `serverless computing` is beneficial.

4. **Automation and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: SREs automate processes and manage infrastructure using tools like `Ansible`, `Chef`, `Puppet`, or `Terraform`.

5. **Monitoring and Incident Management**: Proficiency in monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Nagios, Datadog) and incident management processes (e.g., Incident response, SLAs, MTTR) is important for identifying and resolving system issues.

6. **Networking and Security**: Understanding `TCP/IP networking, DNS, load balancing, firewalls, and network security` is necessary for managing system reliability.

7. **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**: Familiarity with CI/CD practices and tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Travis CI) is important for automating software builds, testing, and deployments.
