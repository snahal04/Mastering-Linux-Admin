# skills required to become system reliability engineer
1. System Administration: Proficiency in system administration skills is crucial. This includes knowledge of operating systems (such as Linux), system configuration, package management, file systems, and monitoring tools.

2. Programming and Scripting: Strong programming skills are essential for an SRE. You should be proficient in at least one programming language (such as Python, Go, or Java) and have experience with scripting languages like Bash or PowerShell.

3. Cloud Computing: Familiarity with cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is important. Understanding cloud concepts, infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools, and services like virtual machines, containers, and serverless computing is beneficial.

4. Automation and Infrastructure as Code (IaC): SREs automate processes and manage infrastructure using tools like Ansible, Chef, Puppet, or Terraform. Knowledge of IaC principles and experience with configuration management tools is valuable.

5. Monitoring and Incident Management: Proficiency in monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Nagios, Datadog) and incident management processes (e.g., Incident response, SLAs, MTTR) is important for identifying and resolving system issues.

6. Networking and Security: Understanding TCP/IP networking, DNS, load balancing, firewalls, and network security is necessary for managing system reliability. Knowledge of network protocols and security practices is beneficial.

7. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD): Familiarity with CI/CD practices and tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Travis CI) is important for automating software builds, testing, and deployments.

8. Problem-Solving and Troubleshooting: SREs need strong problem-solving and troubleshooting skills to diagnose and resolve system issues efficiently. Being able to analyze logs, perform root cause analysis, and implement effective solutions is crucial.

9. Collaboration and Communication: SREs work closely with cross-functional teams, including developers, operations, and management. Strong communication and collaboration skills are essential for effective teamwork and resolving system issues.

10. Performance Optimization: Understanding performance monitoring, profiling, and optimization techniques is important for identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks and ensuring system scalability.

11. Documentation and Knowledge Sharing: SREs should have the ability to document system architectures, procedures, and incident resolutions. Effective knowledge sharing helps build a collective understanding and facilitates collaboration within the team.
